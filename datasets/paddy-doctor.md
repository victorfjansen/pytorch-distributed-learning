# Paddy Disease Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on automated paddy disease classification using a deep learning approach. The dataset we used for training is the Paddy Doctor Visual Image Dataset, which is available on IEEE DataPort. This dataset provides a comprehensive collection of images related to paddy diseases, making it ideal for benchmarking and training machine learning models.

## Dataset

We utilized the larger version of the Paddy Doctor Visual Image Dataset, which is approximately 4.92GB in size. This dataset was instrumental in training our models to achieve high accuracy in classifying various paddy diseases.

### Access the Dataset
